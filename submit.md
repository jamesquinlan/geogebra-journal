# Submit a Manuscript

<p class="page-lead">
The North American GeoGebra Journal welcomes work on the use of GeoGebra in
mathematics education, K&ndash;16. There are no submission fees and no
publication fees, at any stage.
</p>

Submission and peer review happen on GitHub, in the open. Before you begin,
please know what that means:

- **Review is public and signed.** The review conversation takes place in a
  public GitHub issue, reviewers are named, and the thread is permanent and
  citable &mdash; whether the paper is accepted or not.
- **You write in Markdown.** You submit a `paper.md` file; the journal builds the
  typeset PDF for you, in the NAGJ house style.
- **A GeoGebra applet is welcome but not required.** A paper that gives the
  construction commands, or figures a reader can follow, is complete without one.
  Where a resource does exist, you host it (normally on geogebra.org) and we
  record its permanent URL. We do not host applets.

## How to submit

<div class="card">
<div class="card-title">Step 1 &middot; Start from the template</div>
<p>
Create your manuscript from the article template. Click <strong>Use this
template</strong> to get your own repository with <code>paper.md</code>,
a bibliography, a figures folder, and a workflow that builds your PDF.
</p>
<a class="btn primary" href="https://github.com/NorthAmericanGeoGebraJournal/article-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

</a>
</div>

<div class="card">
<div class="card-title">Step 2 &middot; Write your paper</div>
<p>
Write in <code>paper.md</code> using Markdown for text and LaTeX for
mathematics. Push to your repository and the build workflow produces a PDF in
the journal's style, so you can see exactly how your article will look before
you submit. See the <a href="#preparation">preparation guidelines</a> below.

<div class="card">
<div class="card-title">Step 3 &middot; Open a submission issue</div>
<p>
When your manuscript is ready, open a submission issue in the editorial
repository. The form walks you through the author checklist and records your
consent to open review. An editor checks scope and conflicts, then assigns
reviewers.

<h2 id="preparation">Manuscript preparation</h2>

Your `paper.md` front matter carries the article's metadata &mdash; it becomes
the PDF, the article page, and the citation record. Include:

- **Title**
- **Authors** &mdash; name, affiliation, ORCID and email where available; mark
  the corresponding author
- **Abstract** &mdash; roughly 200 words, one paragraph, no citations
- **Keywords**
- **Article type** &mdash; Research Article, Teaching Note, Classroom Activity,
  or Technical Note

The body then contains your text, mathematics, figures, and references. Do not
include volume, issue, or page numbers &mdash; the journal assigns those at
acceptance.

**The question reviewers care about most:** could a reader recreate what you
describe? Satisfy it with a linked GeoGebra resource, the construction commands,
or figures with a described procedure. Any one is enough; an applet is not
required.
